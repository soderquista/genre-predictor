and a roll with a so much soul\nYou could rock 'til you're hundred and one years old\nI don't mean to brag I don't mean to boast\nBut we're like hot butter on a breakfast toast\nWe rock it up a baby bubba\nBaby bubba to the boogie the bang-bang the boogie\nTo the beat beat it's so unique\nCome on everybody and dance to the beat\n \n\n \nA hip-hop the hippie the hippie\nTo the hip hip-hop and you don't stop\nA rock it out baby bubba to the boogie the bang-bang\nThe boogie to the boogie the beat\n\n \nI say I can't wait 'til the end of the week\nWhen I'm rapping to the rhythm of a groovy beat\nAn attempt to raise your body heat\nA just blow your mind so a that you can't speak\nA do a thing but a rock and shuffle your feet\nAnd let it change up to a dance called the freak\nAnd when ya finally do come into your rhythmic beat\nRest a little while so ya don't get weak\nI know a man named Hank\nHe has more rhymes than a serious bank\nSo come on Hank a sing that song\nA to the rhythm of the boogie the bang-bang the bong\n\n \nWell I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp\nThe women fight for my delight\nBut I'm the grandmaster with the three MCs\nThat shock the house for the young ladies\nAnd when you come inside into the front\nYou do the freak spank and do the bump\nAnd when the sucker MCs try to prove a point\nWe're treacherous trio a with a serious joint\nA from sun to sun and from day to day\nI sit down and write a brand new rhyme\nBecause they say that miracles never cease\nI've created a devastating masterpiece\nI'm gonna rock the mic 'til you can't resist\nEverybody I say it goes like this\nWell I was coming home late one dark afternoon\nReporter stopped me for a interview\nShe said she's heard stories and she's heard fables\nThat I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables\nThis young reporter I did adore\nSo I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before\nShe said \"Damn fly guy I'm in love with you\nThe Casanova legend must have been true\"\nI said \"By the way baby what's your name\"\nSaid \"I go by the name Lois Lane\"\nAnd you could be my boyfriend you surely can\nJust let me quit my boyfriend called Superman\nI said \"He's a fairy I do suppose\nFlying through the air in pantyhose\nHe may be very sexy or even cute\nBut he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit\"\nI said \"You need a man who's got finesse\nAnd his whole name across his chest\nHe may be able to fly all through the night\nBut can he rock a party 'til the early light\nHe can't satisfy you with his little worm\nBut I can bust you out with my super sperm\"\nI go do it I go do it I go do it do it do it\nAn' I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank I'm everywhere\nA just throw your hands up in the air\nAnd party hardy like you just don't care\nLet's do it a don't stop y'all a tick a tock y'all you don't stop\n\n \nIt go \"Hotel motel a what you gonna do today\" Say what\n'Cause I'm gon' get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ\nEverybody go \"Hotel motel Holiday Inn\"\nYou see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friend\n\n \nI say skip dive what can I say\nI can't fit 'em all inside my OJ\nSo I just take half and bust them out\nI give the rest to Master Gee so he could shock the house\n\n \nIt was twelve o'clock a one Friday night\nI was rocking to the beat and feeling alright\nEverybody was dancing on the floor\nDoing all the things they never did before\nAnd then this fly fly girl with a sexy lean\nShe came into the bar she came into the scene\nAs she traveled deeper inside the room\nAll the fellas checked out her white Sassoons\nShe came up to the table looked into my eyes\nThen she turned around and shook her behind\nSo I said to myself its time for me to release\nMy vicious rhyme I call my masterpiece\nAnd now people in the house this is just for you\nA little rap to make you boogaloo\nNow the group ya hear is called Phase 2\nAnd let me tell ya something we're a hell of a crew\nOnce a week we're on the street\nJust a cutting the jams and making it freak\nFor you to party got to have the moves\nSo we'll get right down and give you a groove\nFor you to dance you got to be hype\nSo we'll get right down and make ya rock\nNow the system's on and the girls are there\nYou definitely have a rocking affair\nBut let me tell ya something there's still one fact\nThat to have a party got to have a rap\nSo when the party's over you're making it home\nAnd trying to sleep before the break of dawn\nAnd while ya sleeping you start to dream\nAnd thinking how ya danced on the disco scene\nA name appears in your mind\nYeah a name you know that was right on time\nIt was Phase 2 a just a doing the do\nRocking ya down 'cause ya know we could\nTo the rhythm of the beat that makes ya freak\nA come alive girls a get on your feet\nTo the rhythm of the beat to the beat the beat\nTo the double beat-beat that it makes ya freak\nTo the rhythm of the beat that says you go on\nOn and on until the break of dawn\nNow I got a man coming on right now\nHe's guaranteed to throw down\nHe goes by the name of Wonder Mike\nA come on Wonder Mike do what ya like\n\n \nI say a can of beer that's sweeter than honey\nLike a millionaire that has no money\nLike a rainy day that is not wet\nLike a gambling fiend that does not bet\nLike Dracula without his fangs\nLike the boogie to the boogie without the boogie-bang\nLike collard greens that don't taste good\nLike a tree that's not made out of wood\nLike going up and not coming down\nIs just like the beat without the sound no sound\nTo the beat beat ya do the freak\nEverybody just rock and dance to the beat\nHave you ever went over a friend's house to eat\nAnd the food just ain't no good\nI mean the macaroni's soggy the peas are mushed\nAnd the chicken tastes like wood\nA so you try to play it off like you think you can\nBy saying that you're full\nAnd then your friend says \"Mama he's just being polite\nHe ain't finished uh-uh that's bull\"\nA so your heart starts pumping and you think of a lie\nAnd you say that you already ate\nAnd your friend says \"Man there's plenty of food\"\nSo you pile some more on your plate\nBut while the stinky food's steaming your mind starts to dreaming\nOf the moment that it's time to leave\nAnd then you look at your plate and your chicken's slowly rotting\nInto something that looks like cheese\nOh so you say that's it I got to leave this place\nI don't care what these people think\nI'm just sitting here making myself nauseous\nWith this ugly food that stinks\nOh so you bust out the door while it's still closed\nStill sick from the food you ate\nAnd then you run to the store for quick relief\nFrom a bottle of Kaopectate\nAnd then you call your friend a two weeks later\nTo see how he has been\nAnd he says \"I understand about the food\nBaby bubba but we're still friends\"\n\n \nA with a hip-hop the hippie to the hippie\nThe hip hip-hop and you don't stop the rockin'\nTo the bang-bang boogie say up jump the boogie\nTo the rhythm of the boogie the beat\n\n \nI said \"A Hank a can ya rock\nCan ya rock to the rhythm that just don't stop\nA can ya hip me to the shoobie doo\"\nI said \"A come on make m-make the people move\"\n\n \nI go toot the horns and then ring the bell\nBecause I am the man with the clientele\nAnd if ya ask me why I rock so well\nI'm Big Bank I got clientele\nAnd from the time I was only six years old\nI never forgot what I was told\nIt was the best advice that I ever had\nIt came from my wise dear old dad\nHe said \"Sit down punk I wanna talk to you\nAnd don't say a word until I'm through\nNow there's a time to laugh a time to cry\nA time to live and a time to die\nA time to break and a time to chill\nTo act civilized or act real ill\nBut whatever ya do in your lifetime\nYa never let a MC steal your rhyme\"\nSo from '66 to this very day\nI'll always remember what he had to say\nSo when the sucker MCs try to chump my style\nI let them know that I'm versatile\nI got style finesse and a little black book\nThat's filled with rhymes and I know you wanna look\nBut the thing that separates you from me\nAnd that is called originality\nBecause my rhymes are on from what you've heard\nI didn't even bite not a god**** word\nAnd I say a little more later on tonight\nSo the sucker MCs can bite all night\nA tick a tock y'all a beat-beat y'all\nA lets rock y'all ya don't stop\n\n \nIt go \"Hotel motel a whatcha gonna do today\" Say what\n'Cause I'ma get a fly girl gonna get some spank and drive off in a def OJ\nEverybody go \"Hotel motel Holiday Inn\"\nYou see if your girl starts acting up then you take her friends\n\n \nA like that y'all a to the beat y'all\nA beat-beat y'all ya don't stop\nA Master Gee am I mellow\nIt's on you so whatcha gonna do\n\n \nWell like Johnny Carson on the late show\nA like Frankie Crocker in stereo\nA like the Bar-Kays singing \"Holy Ghost\"\nThe sounds I throw down a they're played the most\nJust a like my man a Captain Sky\nWhose name he earned with his super sperm\nWe rock and we don't stop\nA get off y'all I'm here to give you whatcha got\nA to the beat that it makes you freak\nAnd come alive girl a get on your feet\nA like a Perry Mason without a case\nLike Farrah Fawcett without her face\nLike the Bar-Kays on the mic\nLike getting right down for you tonight\nLike moving your body so ya don't know how\nRight to the rhythm and throw down\nLike coming alive to the Master Gee\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\nI said the age of one my life begun\nAt the age of two I was doing the do\nAt the age of three it was you and me\nRocking to the sounds of the Master Gee\nAt the age of four I was on the floor\nGiving all the freaks what they bargained for\nAt the age of five I didn't take no jive\n'Cause with the Master Gee it's all the way live\nAt the age of six I was a picking up sticks\nRapping to the beat my stick was fixed\nAt the age of seven I was rocking in heaven\nDon't ya know I went off\nI gotta run on down to the beat you see\nGetting right on down making all the girls\nJust take of their clothes to the beat the beat\nTo the double beat-beat that makes you freak\nAt the age of eight I was a really great\n'Cause every night you see I had a date\nAt the age of nine I was a right on time\n'Cause every night I had a party rhyme\nWe're going on and on and on on and on\nThe beat don't stop until the break of dawn\nA saying on and on and on on and on\nLike a hot buttered the pop the pop the popcorn\nA going on and on and don't ya dare stop\nA rock-rock y'all a gimme what ya got\n'Cause I'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic\nAnd I am the definite freak's delight\nI'm a hell of a man when I'm on the mic\nI am the definite freak's delight\nThey call me the Master Gee you see\nThe brother who rocks so viciously\n\n \nI'm gonna move ya here I'm gonna move ya there\nI'm gonna move you outta this atmosphere\n'Cause I'm one of a kind and I'll shocks your mind\nI'll put the t-t-tickets in your behind\nSaid just rock it to the east and move it to the west\nMove it toward the lady you love-love the best\nMaster Gee get it on\nTaggin' all the girls goin' down\nGimme time I'ma shock your mind\nA come and jig-jig-jigglin' your behind ","16":" \nYou are now about to witness the strength of street knowledge\n

with wheels Christianity began less than two years ago The printing press came this year and then less than two months ago during this whole 50-year span of human history the steam engine provided a new source of power\n\nNewton explored the meaning of gravity Last month electric lights and telephones and automobiles and airplanes became available Only last week did we develop penicillin and television and nuclear power and now if America's new spacecraft succeeds in reaching Venus we will have literally reached the stars before midnight tonight\nThis is a breathtaking pace and such a pace cannot help but create new ills as it dispels old new ignorance new problems new dangers Surely the opening vistas of space promise high costs and hardships as well as high reward\n\nSo it is not surprising that some would have us stay where we are a little longer to rest to wait But this city of Houston this State of Texas this country of the United States was not built by those who waited and rested and wished to look behind them This country was conquered by those who moved forward--and so will space\n\nWilliam Bradford speaking in 1630 of the founding of the Plymouth Bay Colony said that all great and honorable actions are accompanied with great difficulties and both must be enterprised and overcome with answerable courage\n\nIf this capsule history of our progress teaches us anything it is that man in his quest for knowledge and progress is determined and cannot be deterred The exploration of space will go ahead whether we join in it or not and it is one of the great adventures of all time and no nation which expects to be the leader of other nations can expect to stay behind in the race for space\n\nThose who came before us made certain that this country rode the first waves of the industrial revolutions the first waves of modern invention and the first wave of nuclear power and this generation does not intend to founder in the backwash of the coming age of space We mean to be a part of it--we mean to lead it For the eyes of the world now look into space to the moon and to the planets beyond and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest but by a banner of freedom and peace We have vowed that we shall not see space filled with weapons of mass destruction but with instruments of knowledge and understanding\n\nYet the vows of this Nation can only be fulfilled if we in this Nation are first and therefore we intend to be first In short our leadership in science and in industry our hopes for peace and security our obligations to ourselves as well as others all require us to make this effort to solve these mysteries to solve them for the good of all men and to become the world's leading space-faring nation\n\nWe set sail on this new sea because there is new knowledge to be gained and new rights to be won and they must be won and used for the progress of all people For space science like nuclear science and all technology has no conscience of its own Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man and only if the United States occupies a position of pre-eminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war I do not say that we should or will go unprotected against the hostile misuse of space any more than we go unprotected against the hostile use of land or sea but I do say that space can be explored and mastered without feeding the fires of war without repeating the mistakes that man has made in extending his writ around this globe of ours\n\nThere is no strife no prejudice no national conflict in outer space as yet Its hazards are hostile to us all Its conquest deserves the best of all mankind and its opportunity for peaceful cooperation may never come again But why some say the moon Why choose this as our goal And they may well ask why climb the highest mountain Why 35 years ago fly the Atlantic Why does Rice play Texas\nWe choose to go to the moon We choose to go to the moon in this decade and do the other things not because they are easy but because they are hard because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept one we are unwilling to postpone and one which we intend to win and the others too ","56":" \nYou fuckin haters must be blind to the fact\nThat I'm grinding I got Tech N9ne on the track\nI'm supplying the crack all the hustlers need\nAnd my UGH fam make you

is an illusion\nPoliticans receive power only to abuse it\nThe media controls almost all of our beliefs\nThere aree so many wolves wearing the clothes of sheep\nIt's time for us to weed out these individuals\nTime to realise who are the real criminals\nPeople doing jail-time for a nick sack\nWhile mothers are free to smoke crack\nIt's a well known fact that the government lies\nThey live

random asshole's patented plan\nTo spoil my day in a selfish manner\nBut I was placed to raise cadavers\nAnd turn some brains to fecal matter\nAn advocate of street justice hunting down the bustas\nWith lethal injection of Satan's piss for baby fuckers\nYou can breathe the decrepitness parasitic disease to end us\nOnly a female's vagina will ever determine when Playz is fucked\nMy mind desensitized by life and the burden we live for wealth\nThat's why the devil looks in the mirror and sees Playz within himself\nIt's my rich quick seminar behind a mind with a devil heart\nIdoled eyes will rip you apart stab in the back a weaker man's target\nI seen about all of it falling quick; no Pologrim\nIntravenous fiendish folks swallowing dick for a partial hit\nSomething to kill the pain a bit but I keep holding out\nProtect my family til the end shotgun humping a zombie mouth\n\n \nAs I strive for success I could give a fuck less\nAbout anybody trnna take me down regardless\nOf the governmental structures shutting down it's bullshit\nBut the cops can keep on locking up my clowns it's senseless\nSo prepare the masses for many cranium smashes\nUpon the skulls I'll be laughing when apocalypse happens\nAnd the economy crashes and Earth's destructive habits\nWill establish a new world order now can you imagine\nBody parts for currency black stock marketing\nAnd every building burning off the sweet smell of kerosene\nWith big brother rolling in a bullet-proof limousine\nPeeping out the scene holding military magazines\nIt's flattering amist all global blood splattering\nAnd flag tattering the motherfuckers can mention me\nThe epitome of kings YDMC and INT with Techa Nin\nThis is Real Timne this is not a dream\n\n \nYo I can't get it outta me the sickness inside of me\nFuck your psychology think I need a lobotomy\nI got voices fucking demons taking over my mind\nTelling me that I'm fucked I'm running out of time\nAnd I try and try but there's no escape\nAnd all I really wanna do is leave this place\nNow the world is burning slow in jet black haze\nWhile everyone is stuck in this illusionary maze\nWe keep it strange; though the times have changed\nAnd the industry decided to fill the game with lames\nThey're all the same carbon copies put to shame\nClaiming they're hard Well I bring the pain\nBurning all these bitches while I'm spitting

lesson that I found when I lived in sin\nI guess I should sit down and hold my breath\nThis world needs a hero but there's no one left\nSo I'll lead by example and take up arms\nFuck the man in charge time to ring the alarm\nThis world is fucked but we can still make a difference\nFind a purpose for existance instead of living as a witness\n\n \nAnd maybe they be noticing how I be floating things\nLike Pennywise's balloons or \"Half-Baked\" buffoons\nChappelle & Bruer Excell but sooner on shrooms\nAin't pulling no strings for no bitches\nWhen they keep obsessing over it they're

in my mind state I'm always trnna find ways and crime pays\nWhen you haven't eaten for 5 days\nAnd get a sucky ass check for nothing I ain't gon' die today\nImma hustle until the death of me\nUntil there's nothing left in me so just let me be\nI'll make you motherfuckers rest in peace\nWhen I grab the strap and go shoot at the police\nStarting some armageddon shit you don't want it with BMD\nThen dump ya body in the swimming pool\nAfter I get what the fuck I need then I bounce like the shit was cool\nEven though the shit wasn't cool\nI gotta play it cool that's what the fuck I gotta do\nI gotta mek these moves tell me what do I got to lose\nI had to go and get up on this track with Tech\nBefore the y figure out what I did and start asking questions\nWho the fuck wanna test this in Real Time\nCause Real Time's hectic\n\n \nOn this mic I wreck shit eating cinnamon toasted haters for breakfast\nThat's how I kepe a full health gauge you don't wanna be thinking about a deathwish\nThe world ends but then who be welcome\nWho in the kingdom of Heaven Who down in Hell's pit\nDo you live for the greater good or the devil shit\nAre you a puppet not comprehending

haywire\nEverybody is killing themsleves for their own motherfucking desire\nThis world's gone insane\nReady to blow up with the dust cause there's nothing left\nThe dead will rise again and there's nothing you can do\nThere's nothing left in this world\nEverybody's gonna die and that's the truth\nNothing left alive no one's gonna survive\nIn the end there is no life\nHeaven or Hell Wait in

horror gaming eloquently known as Resident Evil For it\u2019s time though it didn\u2019t coin the term \u201csurvival horror\u201d with it\u2019s predecessors such as Alone in the Dark and possibly Sweet Home being the first for which Resident Evil is actually the spiritual successor of it was one of the first in 3D capability that was able to get most if not all of it\u2019s aspects right Even by today\u2019s standards the classic titan still manages to incite fear among the masses of audiences it\u2019s available to\n\nTime would pass as well as the sequel to Resident Evil before in 1999 another franchise would establish it\u2019s own brand of horror albeit with a more psychological effect established through ambiance environment and a town\u2019s history that pulled the player in with it\u2019s share of cut-scenes articles to detail it\u2019s history and often relatable characters that were no more than everyday people This was the dawn of Silent Hill and it was glorious The franchise made a living not just off of monster design but effective use of such as well as the constant feeling of claustrophobia and narrative the birth of it\u2019s iconic figure Pyramid Head living as symbolism specifically designated for Silent Hill 2 as a gesture towards judgementFirst Nail in the CoffinIt should be noted that during it\u2019s entire construction the first 3 games rendered as classics between the franchise and horror gaming in general were all constructed by Team Silent all brought in by various Konami directors of which mostly remained constant except for the primary directors themselves though still keeping otheraspects the same such as the writing production and soundtrack The first escalated change in the series was the introduction of Silent Hill 4 abandoning the city itself in change for the only person in correlation with it the antagonist Walter SullivanNow this major change came as a surprise to most in abandoning the town it\u2019s loved most in order for a relative even causing most people to speculate around the internet that the entry in the series was originally supposed to be the spawn of an entirely new franchise Realistically this more correlated to the start of a trend that would cause the fall of more Eastern-orientated franchises which was attempting to market to western audiences Silent Hill 4 along with games like Resident Evil: Outbreak Code Veronica and Resident Evil 4 attempted to reach wider audiences by evolving with more action-orientated gameplay Now this isn\u2019t to take credit away from those games with each being good in their own sense or right but it makes the reformation in Silent Hill\u2019s franchise make a lot more senseSecond Nail in the CoffinAfter 2004 once Silent Hill 4 had caught enough attention Resident Evil 4 executed the perfect example of how to splice genres and come out successful in the end with critical acclaim something Team Silent was unfortunately unable to do which led to their forced disbandment by Konami So in order to try and replicate their success Konami began to pitch the franchise off to more western developers starting off with Silent Hill: Homecoming assembled by Double Helix Games in 2008Third Nail in the CoffinThis is what metaphorically and quite literally killed the Order Silent Hill: Homecoming if anything served as a rehash of past deeds from the past 4 games featuring Pyramid Head for absolutely no reason faulty plot points with an expected twist and overall botch job on how to hand your franchise over to a random western develop team as their first video game on recordDespite this Konami continued to try and find that blend of action gore and shock value that kept more western franchises held together like FEAR Dead Space and Left 4 Dead only leading to more decent at best releases from studios with better thoughts in concepts rather than executions finally leading up to Silent Hill: Downpour in 2012 once more developed by an inexperienced studioFinal Nail in the CoffinBy this point it\u2019s hard to see it get worse right But even through a simple job of remastering the graphics of two already made video games Konami managed to hand the series off to one more underdeveloped company that would make unneeded changes and cause the downfall of one of the simplest job\u2019s in the games existenceThis resulted in even getting the negative attention of one of the originating members of Team Silent and the creator of Pyramid Head himself along with any and all monsters between the first 3 games Masahiro Ito when asked his opinion on a pair of screenshots comparing the original product to the remaster via TwitterAnd the one thing Ito had to sayNow my piece\u2026Konami isn\u2019t necessarily known to care much for it\u2019s IP\u2019s with the exception of Kojima Productions and everything Metal Gear If it literally wasn\u2019t for Kojima Konami would\u2019ve bankrupted awhile ago or at least had to actually focus on creating games with some integrity I mean you can even look at the longer-standing Castlevania I mean Lord of Shadows Practically steals elements from Shadow of the Colossus God of War and Dante\u2019s Inferno and that\u2019s before I even watched the Zero Punctuation review Once more the problem with that was immediately trying to modernize something that\u2019s been old for the last 3 years which is damn near 50 years gamer time in order to aim for some sort of new audience which didn\u2019t work even with Kojima\u2019s helpI mean I do get some of the problems that works in co-operation with horror because really it\u2019s a market that takes some damn finesse in and you probably won\u2019t get the biggest return immediately due to not covering as accessible an experience as most action-adventure games but once you have indie developers making better games than some of the biggest blockbusters and teams available can even think about and still making money\u2026 sigh\n\nGuys like Shinji Mikami the original director of the Resident Evil 1 \u2014 4 games as well as other creative works like Viewtiful Joe God Hand Vanquish and otherwise have lasted in this industry and thrived off creativity regardless of how many sales whatever project could pull and it\u2019s served him well Keiichiro Toyama as the original director for Silent Hill 1 managed to thrive off of the Siren series without sacrificing anything I\u2019m just waiting for the day Konami and Capcom for that matter can see that it was the original psychological effect of these horror games including Fatal Frame that kept is up at night not some bullshit they learned off of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or the latest Robb Zombie movieIn ConsolationThough this information is only covering late 2012 it does give me some hope for the future as well as Shinji directing another horror game for the first time in almost 10 years I believe it\u2019s taken long enough for these developers to realize action sells but playing on the human mind is why we got into this It\u2019s what quickens our heart rates cause our thoughts to go into a state irrationality makes us run away from the monsters with only 2 bullets left and even in a state where everything seems calm helps us remain in a state of fear and constant paranoia and in that way personally helps me feel alive in a sense\n\nAnd I wouldn\u2019t have it any other wayAll Hail The OrderUPDATE AS OF GAMESCOM ","68":" \n\n \nLivin' easy\nLovin' free\nSeason ticket on a one way ride\nAskin' nothin'\nLeave me be\nTakin'

navy color dark and shiny and full extending maybe a not-outrageous half centimeter up from the top lid extending an additional still-not-crazy three centimeters outward past where her eyes end Her eyelashes are even and delicate like wisps from a dandelion and I can't recall if I've ever seen her without prosthetic versions I have had plenty of time to search my memory though because here on this couch in this room during this interview with me sitting next to her Nicki Minaj has fallen asleep\n\nWe are at Barclays Center in one of the dressing rooms which are low low beneath Brooklyn; most are named after streets and neighborhoods in the borough During the rehearsals for Fashion Rocks the New York Fashion Week concert fund-raiser the halls were filled with publicists and escorts who had to pretend not to be dazzled by those they were escorting Minaj had walked in a few minutes before tiny next to her assistant and her muscle wearing black sunglasses a trucker hat cocked to the side and a T-shirt with the periodic-table box for carbon She had been led straight into the DeKalb dressing room named for the street that bisects a couple of local neighborhoods now populated by yuppies but that still contain housing projects Her smile is a warm sun As is this room The temperature in here has been set to about 300 degrees at Nicki's request She says she gets cold a lot\n\nNext door to her is the Canarsie dressing room\u2014I actually grew up in Canarsie; it's still a dump\u2014and inside is Usher who at the MTV Video Music Awards last month slapped Nicki's ass and continues to slap it endlessly in GIFs all over the Internet Nicki was the star of the VMAs that night Her hot humpy performance of \"Anaconda\" was part of a medley and it was followed by a quick costume change that didn't quite reach completion: She had to pinch the two breast-covering flaps of her black dress closed because her cue for the finale of the opener \"Bang Bang\" with Jessie J and Ariana Grande came before she could zip She power-walked in like a boss joining the other two onstage both of them so skinny and with such rough angles and straight edges and reaching so hard for some soul Nicki destroyed them\n\nThis is what she does She takes a pretty good song waits until you are popping along to it then a little longer until it feels repetitive and you start to see through to its flaws and then boom she comes in and makes it a completely different song\u2014a better song She is the best part even of great songs; her featured verse on Kanye West's \"Monster\" is the best of several including ones by Jay Z and Rick Ross She did that song because she was asked and because \"Kanye's a genius\" She did \"Bang Bang\" because she \"knew it would be big\"\n\nIn the dressing room on the other side of Nicki's the Empire named after a boulevard in Brooklyn that sounds regal but is even rougher than Canarsie ever was is JLo I could write a dissertation about the two seconds during which MTV caught JLo watching Nicki do \"Anaconda\" at the VMAs Perhaps JLo in those seconds stares at Nicki and considers her own youth and also that this is what she has wrought that back when she brought this whole butt thing into the mainstream all those years ago she went out of her way to be discreet to keep us wanting more to never let us look her ass directly in its eye that it was an ass of implication and innuendo\u2014that if she may she made asses safe for the white folks at home in a way they never had been before Who knew that just giving the people what they wanted would yield such success In those two seconds JLo's look is a mixture of pride and despair\n\nIt has been counterpointed to me that perhaps JLo was just thinking of how far we'd all come that now we can all celebrate our asses I don't know; maybe if she didn't have a new album out I'd agree Contact me to debate this; I will make myself available I want to talk about asses so much I want to know what it is we're telling the world when we use our asses in the way that Nicki has been using her ass\u2014when they are not the accent in a video but the point of it\n\nAnd most of all of course I want to know Nicki's thoughts on this I was awake there in the DeKalb and I had questions She was asleep which was fine I suppose because she didn't appear to have answers anyway\n\nThe Versus Versace party she'd attended the night before our interview had yielded a plastic case filled with M&M's\u2014an odd party favor something I've received at bar mitzvahs She pulled it out of her purse as we talked in the basement of Barclays and this would be my only indication that she recognized she needed a boost The case was taped closed so I offered to open it for her; her nails a pointy taupe manicure were making it hard We ate some together and she noticed that they each had the Versus lion insignia on them \"Isn't that crazy\" she said impressed\n\nShe's into branding these days particularly her own In the \"Anaconda\" video there are no fewer than five products placed prominently for advertising: her Beats by Dre speakers imprint and her Moscato but also a Victoria's Secret bra some Air Jordans and a baffling \"teatox\" drink called MateFit dialysis machine sold separately It's not exactly seamless integration and at times it is so overt that it feels like a comment on the culture of branding maybe some poignant thought about sex and consumerism\n\nNope \"My management team has a division that has a guy that his main focus is to go out there and find new brands for me to do business with or to find brands that would like to be in our videos and contribute to our budget\" she says It's like a Kickstarter but for a multi-millionaire\n\nShe was not born wealthy Nicki 31 grew up in Queens and attended LaGuardia the high school from Fame She says her father once tried to burn down her house while her mother was inside She did odd jobs after school: She was a customer-service rep for a while but that didn't go great \"I like dealing with people but I don't really like a lot of bullshit so maybe customer service wasn't the best job for me\" She was fired from a waitressing job at a Red Lobster after she followed a couple who had taken her pen into the parking lot and then flipped them the bird I asked her if it was a special pen \"No\" she said \"It was the principle\"\n\nShe came to prominence in outsize italic caps-lock Technicolor exaggeration\u2014pink wigs outrageous outfits eyelashes that were a comment about eyelashes She had different personas\u2014alter egos she called them\u2014with names and backstories She did funny accents and was willing to make herself beautiful then grotesque then absurd then back again And here she is now demure by comparison just plain old black extensions just a T-shirt about carbon\n\n\"I always thought that by the time I put out a third album I would want to come back to natural hair and natural makeup\" she told me \"I thought I will shock the world again and just be more toned down I thought that would be more shocking than to keep on doing exactly what they had already seen\"\nShe no longer feels as if she needs to hide behind outrageousness This next chapter is about success Nicki Minaj is rap's first and only female mogul having parlayed all your ogling into a spot on Forbes's Cash Kings list\u2014the only person of our gender paid well enough to be so honored She is the top-charting woman in rap a top-charting rapper in general and a crossover phenomenon who can go back and forth between hip-hop and pop the way Taylor Swift can no longer go back and forth between country and pop\n\nA few days earlier she'd been in Los Angeles finishing up her third album The Pinkprint out this month and she's changed things \"a billion times\" because she's a perfectionist Her first two albums were big hits platinum sellers Already The Pinkprint has yielded a chart-topping single and an unstoppable meme\u2014the \"Anaconda\" cover art features Nicki pants nowhere in sight squatting photographed from behind\u2014but also a quieter Nicki and certainly a more tired one She can't be baited into talking shit about anyone anymore; she answers questions simply and succinctly\n\nNow that we have charted her rise as a cultural force it is time to ask Nicki exactly what she's trying to say If the \"Anaconda\" cover is the autumn of her flamboyance it is time to get what we've wanted all along: an explanation of what exactly is going on here which is something I will ask her the minute she wakes up\n\nTo be completely accurate she never fell into actual REM sleep during our interview but at four separate times she dozed off her head jerking awake at just the moment it had started to dip In between she was what I could call low-key and reserved because I am generous but the picture looked like this: those eyelids falling falling over eyes that would cross momentarily closing for a moment but staying too long\u2014a blink that lasted a few blinks longer than a blink\n\nBut also to be completely fair I'm not sure how she was upright at all This was the middle of New York Fashion Week and if you followed her Instagram every few hours it was a new event with a new dress new hair new makeup It was parties all night all the air-kissing all the red carpets\n\nAnd of course all this fancy dress-up plays into the sort of bodily performance art she's been doing onstage and in her videos since her first mixtape in 2007; that release was called Playtime Is Over and on the cover she was a plastic doll in a box She has put herself in a Barbie box at least twice actually the second time in a video with Mariah Carey She is among the few living women in Kanye's \"Monster\" video which is a landscape of female corpses\u2014\"the strangest video I ever shot\"\u2014and there are two of her in it; one her ties up and whips the other her with a riding crop And now comes this song and video which are clearly about the female form and the male obsession with it She must have something to say about this\n\nNo she says it's just a song there's no hidden meaning no layer beneath \"She\"\u2014Nicki's character in the video\u2014\"is just talking about two guys that she dated in the past and what they're good at and what they bought her and what they said to her It's just cheeky like a funny story\" Cheeky She has to be messing with me\n\nBut \"Anaconda\" samples a song that's literally called \"Baby Got Back\" There must be some thought given to this part of the body considering all the attention it receives Choreography points to it; she boosts it up and it receives applause The song is a five-minute gender-studies symposium\n\nBut Nicki shakes her head: \"All it says is 'My anaconda don't' \" Why are we talking about asses she seems to be saying Sure there is a direct not inferred reference in her lyrics to \"salad tossing\"\u2014which to be clear is the act of being anally probed by someone else's tongue But this is a song about reptiles Don't be such an intellectual\n\nOkay fine You can't deny the video though You can't pretend that there isn't some extreme sexual commentary going on in the video right A steamy women's-only jungle mecca aerobic slithering drumming on a dancer's ass There in the video Nicki is twerking and crawling across the floor to poor hapless Drake sitting in a puddle of his own anticipatory blue balls She slaps him before he can touch her and that has to mean something\n\n\"I knew that I wanted a gym theme\" Shrug \"And that's that\" That's that guys That's that\n\nShe sees me grasping and maybe she feels a little sorry for me so she offers me this: \"I think the video is about what girls do\" She is poking at a salad that hasn't been tossed The dressing came on the side \"Girls love being with other girls and when you go back to us being younger we would have slumber parties and we'd be dancing with our friends\" I'll take her word for it; the slumber parties were not jungle-themed in Canarsie\n\nOkay the \"Anaconda\" cover art then It was almost an afterthought she says the product of a photo shoot on the day that the \"Anaconda\" video was shot \"I just said I'll put it out never thought in a billion years that people would be putting   people's heads on it It's the craziest shit\" I tell her that online I'd seen it as a rocket jet fuel and fire being released from her undercarriage \"What hasn't it been\" she says \"They've made it everything\"\nYou heard it here first \"Anaconda\" is about a snake and also about a woman's ex-boyfriends and the video is just one big slumber party You can release a record cover into the atmosphere that makes all who see it so shocked and discomforted that their only way to metabolize it is to turn it into the world's fastest-spreading meme to the point where her squatting form ends up on a polo shirt right where the little crocodile usually goes You can do all this and still you can look someone in the eye and say that it's not cynical in the least that it's not a comment on gender or sex or the culture or anything Double shrug These are not the droids you're looking for\n\n\"I don't know what there is to really talk about\" she says \"I'm being serious I just see the video as being a normal video\"\n\nWe are winding down because it's time for Nicki to go rehearse For this performance she has incorporated male dancers \"I went in yesterday finally saw the dance for the first time and I saw the guys doing all this sexy stuff that I wasn't a part of And I said 'Hello why aren't they humping me on the stage' \" The choreographer didn't realize that this was something she might want She does: \"We've got to give them something to talk about again\"\n\nSo it's all for shock it's all for talk it's all for hashtags and memes Not even a contrived statement\u2014which is fine it's just that most people at least pretend there's something they're trying to say And so I'm left to wonder where is the woman who pronounced in an MTV documentary that she won't stand for disrespect that she won't accept being given pickle juice at a photo shoot Where is the philosophy and the fire And there in the DeKalb where it is so hot I can see sound I start to wonder if I'm losing it I look over to ask Nicki to suggest that maybe I should take a nap too and we can let our unconsciouses figure this out\u2014I could be her hype man but for naps\u2014except she is out again\n\nThe next night at Fashion Rocks JLo went on before Nicki The song she performed was called \"Booty\" and the only lyrics I could discern were Big big booty \/ what you got a big booty again and again JLo marking her territory If you could troll Nicki Minaj through a song this was it JLo wore a short dress and did a move you mostly see strippers do on cop shows\u2014I'll call it the squatted twerk: knees bent up down up down up down butt close to the ground but never touching it We clapped loudly for this A woman behind me who has no idea how the record-promotion business works panted to her companion \"I hope Nicki does 'Anaconda' \"\n\nRight before I left her the previous night Nicki had stopped me and maybe because she felt bad for me and maybe because she too is generous she had given me two things\u2014a ticket to this show and this tiny morsel:\n\n\"I'm chopping up the banana Did you realize that\"\n\nWhat What banana\n\nIn the \"Anaconda\" video she says \"At first I'm being sexual with the banana and then it's like 'Ha-ha no' \" I ask if she's referring to how the Drake scene immediately follows the kitchen scene \"Yeah that was important for us to show in the kitchen scene because it's always about the female taking back the power and if you want to be flirty and funny that's fine but always keeping the power and the control in everything\"\n\nMaybe she had been messing with me all along\n\nOr maybe she was simply telling me that it is not her job to explain herself I had been warned before the interview that I shouldn't ask about her ass that she finds it degrading and I had chalked up her reticence to that But maybe this is what she finds degrading: to work day and night to get those features down to make actual magic and to make it come out in full articulation every syllable every accent meticulously applied to save someone else's song in the third act to entertain you only to have some asshole come down to the DeKalb dressing room in the two hours that she could have spent taking a real nap not an upright one and ask her what she means when she's doing the thing she does Must she do everything She's not hiding anything\u2014look at her she literally isn't hiding anything It's all there for you to see Do some of the work yourself people She's busy running her brand She's inspiring a meme that will keep us busy for months She is tasting the Moscato and smelling the Nicki Minaj perfume that comes in miniature busts of Nicki Minaj She is not here for your gender-studies symposium It is not her job to tell you who the eff she is And she's exhausted She is only made of carbon after all just like you and me\n\nShe came out in her sparkle bra tearing fiercely across the stage \"Bwoy twoy named Trwoy used to live in Detrwoit\u2026\" JLo was already re-seated and watching the performance and at first she clapped along lazily but then stopped For a variety of reasons it is hard to parse what might be going on in JLo's mind by looking at her face but when Nicki launched into her own dancer-backed squatted twerk\u2014a younger twerk a bouncier twerk\u2014I swear I saw JLo's left eyelid blink out of sequence with her right one a subdermal twitch indicating that perhaps she'd had a rage stroke\n\nMeanwhile onstage Nicki was hoisted up by the male dancers arms in the air in full expression and the sunshine of her smile shone into the arena She was all rested up ","106":" \nI feel like fallin' in love Fallin\u2019 in love\nI'm in the mood to fuck somethin' up Tonight I\u2019m
